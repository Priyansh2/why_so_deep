# Feature Selection

This exercise compares the effectiveness of different methods of feature selection on a randomly generated dataset.

The dataset generated has 20000 samples and 30 features. Only 10 of the 30 features contain information useful for prediction.

A support vector machine with an radial bias function kernel is used to fit the data after each feature selection method.

The following feature selection methods are tested:
 - Univariate Feature Selection
 - Recursive Feature Selection
 - L1 Lasso Feature Selection
 - Tree-Based Feature Selection
 - Principal Component Analysis

## Conclusions

 - For datasets with uncorrelated features, using feature elimination methods can significantly reduce the time required to train a model without reducing test accuracy.
 - Recursive Feature Elimination and Tree Based Feature Selection yielded the greatest increases in training speed.
 - Principal Component Analysis does not reduce the model training time. This may be because PCA retains the variance of all data including that from junk features.
